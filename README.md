My name is Medaly, and I am learning software development. I feel excited about this because it is one of the things I would love to pursue as a career. Beside studying Computer Science, i am also majoring in Economics. I am currently learning Chinese, so I also have a passion for languages and traveling. In my free time I like to dance, and hang out with friends.
